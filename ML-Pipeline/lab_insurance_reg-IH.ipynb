    "## 8. Calculating Potential Cost or Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge:\n",
    "Now that you've built and optimized your models, it's time for the final challenge! Your task is to minimize the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of your model's predictions and calculate the potential financial impact of your model's errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "1. Calculate the RMSE of your final model's predictions.\n",
    "2. Break down the errors into underestimation and overestimation.\n",
    "3. Calculate the total potential cost or loss to the company.\n",
    "4. Compete with your classmates to see who can achieve the lowest RMSE and financial impact!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "The RMSE provides an estimate of the average error in your model's predictions. We will also analyze the errors by categorizing them into underestimations and overestimations to understand their financial impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Calculate Underestimation and Overestimation Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate RMSE**:\n",
    "   - Use the `mean_squared_error` function from `sklearn.metrics` and pass your actual values (`y_test`) and predicted values (`y_pred_final`) to it.\n",
    "   - Take the square root of the result to get the RMSE.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Calculate Underestimation Error**:\n",
    "   - Identify the instances where the actual charges (`y_test`) are greater than the predicted charges (`y_pred_final`).\n",
    "   - For these instances, calculate the difference between the actual and predicted charges.\n",
    "   - Sum these differences to get the total underestimation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Overestimation Error**:\n",
    "   - Identify the instances where the actual charges (`y_test`) are less than the predicted charges (`y_pred_final`).\n",
    "   - For these instances, calculate the difference between the predicted and actual charges.\n",
    "   - Sum these differences to get the total overestimation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Total Potential Cost or Loss**:\n",
    "   - Add the total underestimation error and the total overestimation error to get the total potential cost or loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's see who can build the best model!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate RMSE**:\n",
    "   - Use `mean_squared_error` with `y_test` and `y_pred_final`.\n",
    "   - Use `np.sqrt` to take the square root of the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Underestimation Error**:\n",
    "   - Use a boolean condition to filter `y_test` values that are greater than `y_pred_final`.\n",
    "   - Subtract the predicted values from the actual values for these instances.\n",
    "   - Sum these differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Overestimation Error**:\n",
    "   - Use a boolean condition to filter `y_test` values that are less than `y_pred_final`.\n",
    "   - Subtract the actual values from the predicted values for these instances.\n",
    "   - Sum these differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Total Potential Cost or Loss**:\n",
    "   - Add the results of the underestimation error and overestimation error to get the total potential cost or loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate RMSE**:\n",
    "   - `rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_final))`\n",
    "   - This gives you the average prediction error in dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Underestimation Error**:\n",
    "   - `underestimation_error = np.sum(y_test[y_test > y_pred_final] - y_pred_final[y_test > y_pred_final])`\n",
    "   - This gives you the total amount by which the model undercharged.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Overestimation Error**:\n",
    "   - `overestimation_error = np.sum(y_pred_final[y_test < y_pred_final] - y_test[y_test < y_pred_final])`\n",
    "   - This gives you the total amount by which the model overcharged.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Total Potential Cost or Loss**:\n",
    "   - `total_potential_loss = underestimation_error + overestimation_error`\n",
    "   - This gives you the total financial impact of the model's errors.\n",
